# pyytdownload
A tool to download MP3 and MP4 files from youtube.
You need to run setup.bat before using the tool. It will install dependencies.
SPECIAL NOTE: If your version has a build number lower than 240121 please download and run setup.bat again because some I added some update checking stuff


<b> After the installer finishes, run PyYtDownload.exe (If you use the installer, there is no need to execute setup.bat) <b>
